Installation instructions
-------------------------

#
#Requirements:
# 

    MediaWiki 1.13
    SMW 1.4.2
    Halo extension 1.4.3
    Semantic Forms 1.7.1
    Parser Functions 
    String Functions 2.0 or higher
	
#
# Installation
#

1. Add to your LocalSettings.php: (After the Halo and the 
   Semantic Forms extensions were included)
   
    ---
    include_once('extensions/RichMedia/includes/RM_Initialize.php');
    enableRichMediaExtension();
    
    $wgAllowExternalImages=true;   //This need to be set to allow the templates creating image links.
    ---

2. Go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/RichMedia/import/RichMediaOntology_v1.0.xml'

Now you can enter {{RMList|{{FULLPAGENAME}}}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related documents and media' which also allows you to directly upload new files. 

#
# Notice 
#

If you already used a version of the MIME-Type extension, 
then be sure, that '/extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_MIME_settings.php' sets the namespaces
'Document','Pdf','Audio' and 'Video' as namespaces with semantic links.
If that's not the case, you will have to add to this file:

    ---
    global $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks;
    $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks = $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks + 
    	array( 
    		NS_DOCUMENT => true,
    	 	NS_AUDIO => true,
    	    NS_VIDEO => true,
    		NS_PDF	=> true
    	);
    ---
    
Otherwise it is not possible to do inline queries with articles placed in those namespaces
and that's what is needed for the media list!
