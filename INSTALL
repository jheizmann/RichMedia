Installation instructions
-------------------------

#
#Requirements:
# 

    MediaWiki 1.13
    SMW 1.4.2
    Halo extension 1.4.4
    Semantic Forms 1.7.1
    Parser Functions 
    String Functions 2.0 or higher
	
#
# Installation
#

1. Add to your LocalSettings.php: (After the Halo and the 
   Semantic Forms extensions were included)
   
    ---
    include_once('extensions/RichMedia/includes/RM_Initialize.php');
    enableRichMediaExtension();
    
    $wgAllowExternalImagesFrom=$wgServer;   //This need to be set to allow the templates creating image links.
    ---

2. Go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/RichMedia/import/RichMediaOntology_v1.1.xml'

Now you can enter {{RMList|show=True}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related documents and media' which also allows you to directly upload new files. 

#
# Notice 
#
This template call has changed since last version. Please make sure that you are using the right call now.
If you already used a version of the MIME-Type extension, 
then be sure, that '/extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_MIME_settings.php' sets the namespaces
'Document','Pdf','Audio' and 'Video' as namespaces with semantic links.
If that's not the case, you will have to add to this file:

    ---
    global $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks;
    $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks = $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks + 
    	array( 
    		NS_DOCUMENT => true,
    	 	NS_AUDIO => true,
    	    NS_VIDEO => true,
    		NS_PDF	=> true
    	);
    ---
    
Otherwise it is not possible to do inline queries with articles placed in those namespaces
and that's what is needed for the media list!
If you have already used version 1.0 of RichMedia extension and you have done changes to your templates,
make sure that you merge them with the new ones delivered in this version.
