# Installation
#

1. Add to your LocalSettings.php:
	(if you want pdf and doc files to be converted, set this line before SMW_Initialize.php is included)
	---
	$smwgEnableUploadConverter = true;
	--- 

2. Add to your LocalSettings.php:
	(After the Halo and the Semantic Forms extensions were included)
   
    ---
    include_once('extensions/RichMedia/includes/RM_Initialize.php');
    enableRichMediaExtension();
    
    $wgAllowExternalImagesFrom=$wgServer;   //This need to be set to allow the templates creating image links.
    ---

3. Go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/RichMedia/import/RichMediaOntology_v1.1.xml'

Now you can enter {{RMList|show=True}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related documents and media' which also allows you to directly upload new files. 

#
# Notice 
#
The Rich Media extension now fully includes the MIME-Type extension.
If you already used a version of the MIME-Type extension, then be sure, 
that you have deleted '/extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_MIME_settings.php' and no longer include this file in your LocalSettings.php.

The template call has changed since version 1.0. Please make sure that you are using the right call now.

If you have already used a prior version of RichMedia extension and you have done changes to your templates,
make sure that you merge them with the new ones delivered in this version.
