# Installation
#

1. Patch process:
	1.1 The RichMedia extension comes with several patch files, where two must
    be applied. One file patches Mediawiki and the other the Semantic Forms
    extension. Depending on the version number choose the correct patch file.
	- '/extensions/RichMediaRichMediaPatchForSF2_0.txt': This file provides the necessary patches for Semantic Forms 2.0
	- '/extensions/RichMedia/RichMediaPatchForMW1_15_3.txt': This is needed to patch MediaWiki in version 1.15.3
	- '/extensions/RichMedia/RichMediaPatchForMW1_16_0.txt': This is needed to patch MediaWiki in version 1.16.0

	Note: We can not ensure that this patch works properly for other versions of MediaWiki.
	These are Eclipse patch files which can be installed using the tool patch.php which itself uses GNU patch. The
	patch.php script is included in the zip archive or can be copied from the deploy framework (smwhalo-deploy)
	which also contains a windows binary of GNU patch.

		php patch.php -p <patch-file> -d <mw-dir> --onlypatch

	1.2 The RichMedia extension contains several new files which need to be copied.
	All these files are located in subdirectories of '/extensions/RichMedia/patches'.
	- Copy the folder 'SemanticForms' to your '/extensions' folder to make sure, that
	  among others a new version of the FloatBox is now used by SemanticForms.
	- Copy the folder 'skins' to your <mw-dir> to make sure, that all needed icons are available.

2. Add to your LocalSettings.php:
	(if you want pdf, doc and some other document format files to be converted, set this line before RM_Initialize.php is included)
	---
	$smwgEnableUploadConverter = true;
	--- 

3. Add to your LocalSettings.php:
	(After the Semantic Forms extension is included)

	---
	include_once('extensions/RichMedia/includes/RM_Initialize.php');
	enableRichMediaExtension();

	$wgAllowExternalImagesFrom=$wgServer;   //This need to be set to allow the templates create image links.
	---

4. Seach for the variable $wgEnableUploads in LocalSettings.php and set this to true.
	If this variable is not existent please add the following line to your LocalSettings.php:
	---
	$wgEnableUploads = true;
	--- 

5. Go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/RichMedia/import/RichMediaOntology_v1.5.xml'

6. Go to Special:Upload, select and upload the following two files:
	* '/extensions/RichMedia/skins/Calendar.gif'
	* '/extensions/RichMedia/skins/vcard.gif'

Now you can enter {{RMList|show=True}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related documents and media' which also allows you to directly upload new files.

If you use an older PHP version than 5.2.x, some JSON functions (like json_encode) are missing. Please
install the JSON modules from php pear.

#
# General informations about the MediaWiki upload
#
	* There are several settings that need to be recognized when you want to upload files to your MediaWiki.
	* All these informations can be found at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Uploads.
	* The RichMedia extension only sets: $wgEnableUploads = true;
	* All other configurations that have impact on the upload process have to be set by yourself.

#
# Notice 
#
	* The Rich Media extension now fully includes the MIME-Type extension. If you already used a version of the MIME-Type extension, then be sure, that you have deleted '/extensions/SMWHalo/includes/SMW_MIME_settings.php' and no longer include this file in your LocalSettings.php. 

	* The template call has changed since version 1.0. Please make sure that you are using the right call now. {{RMList|show=True}}

	* If you have already used a prior version of RichMedia extension and you have done changes to your templates, make sure that you merge them with the new ones delivered in this version. 

	* If you are running Semantic Wiki on Unix and want to use the UploadConverter make sure that you have installed the right packages of AbiWord (http://www.abisource.com/) and xpdf (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/). 

If you're using Debian the commands for installing these packages are:
apt-get install xpdf
apt-get install abiword

The conversion of office documents (.doc) may fail on Unix systems due to MIME type detection problems of PHP.

# Installation of the WebDAV server
#

* It may be necessary that you will have to install the Microsoft Windows WebFolders patch,
which is available at: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=17C36612-632E-4C04-9382-987622ED1D64&displaylang=de

* Add the following line of code to your LocalSettings.php:
require_once("$IP/extensions/RichMedia/includes/WebDAV/WD_Initialize.php");

* Connect to the WebDAV server via your WebDAV client using the following URL:
{{WikiURL}}/extensions/RichMedia/includes/WebDAV/WD_WebDAV.php/

* The file {WikiPath}/extensions/RichMedia/includes/WebDAV/WD_Settings.php contains
a configurable namespace blacklist. Namespaces in that blacklist will not be displayed
in the WebDAV folder. The settings file also allows to configure whether talk namespaces should be displayed.
